# Laravel Logs Manager

Set of Artisan commands to handler the logs folder

## Why

Laravel is a great framework but it lacks on some specific tools
like this kind of commands, since it's possible to extend Laravel itself
I've took the plunge.

## How to use

Piece of cake. Grab a copy from composer `composer require ludo237/laravel-logs-manager`
and it's done if you run `php artisan` you will see a new set of commands

### Single Command Explanation (SCE)

W.I.P.
